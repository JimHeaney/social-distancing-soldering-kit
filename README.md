# Social Distancing Soldering Kit

## Overview
Social distancing is key to keeping safe from COVID. While we all know to keep 6 feet apart, how easily can you eyeball 6 feet?

Now you don't have to, and you can learn more about electronics at the same time! This kit includes all the parts and instructions to create an ultrasonic rangefinder, that can measure up to 150 inches (380 cm).

When you no longer need the rangefinder, you can use the 328P microcontroller like an Arduino.
